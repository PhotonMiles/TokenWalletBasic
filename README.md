# Token Wallet Smart Contract

This repository contains a simple Token Wallet smart contract developed in Solidity. The contract allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether, acting as a basic token wallet.

## Features

- Deposit Ether into the wallet.
- Withdraw Ether from the wallet.
- Check the Ether balance of the wallet.

## Getting Started

To interact with this contract, you'll need an Ethereum development environment setup, such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if using Truffle or Hardhat for local development.
- Access to a Solidity development environment like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for online compilation and deployment.

### Using the Contract

1. **Deploy the Contract:**
   - In Remix, paste the contract code into a new file, compile it, and deploy it to a test network or the Ethereum mainnet.
   - For Truffle or Hardhat, compile and migrate the contract to your desired network as per the tools' documentation.

2. **Interact with the Contract:**
   - **Deposit Ether:** Call the `deposit` function with a value to add Ether to your wallet.
   - **Withdraw Ether:** Call the `withdraw` function with the amount of Ether you want to take out from your balance.
   - **Check Balance:** Call the `checkBalance` function to see the current Ether balance of the wallet.
